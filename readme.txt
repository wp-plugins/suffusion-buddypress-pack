A compatibility pack for the Suffusion WordPress theme with the BuddyPress plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin provides compatibility for the <a href='http://www.aquoid.com/news/themes/suffusion'>Suffusion</a> WordPress Theme
with BuddyPress. It is based on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-template-pack/">BuddyPress template pack</a>
for building the basic templates, except that the template markup has been modified to match Suffusion's markup.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for it,
or by uploading the file downloaded from here. Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped
contents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin different from the BuddyPress Template Pack? =

The BuddyPress Template Pack is a generic starting point for making any theme compatible with BuddyPress. Since the markup is
significantly different between the BuddyPress Template Pack and the Suffusion theme, this plugin was built as a pre-packaged
extension for users who want to use Suffusion for BuddyPress.

== Changelog ==

= 1.06 =
*	Moved some function calls out of Suffusion to this plugin to keep Suffusion lighter.
